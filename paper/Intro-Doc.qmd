## Cutie

Hi Cutie!! Im here to teach you some of the basics and as we keep talking i'll update this doc!

## Starting up

R is pretty weak on its own but it can do basic things like:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

But the real power is when you start to use packages

To use a package normally you have to do two things: - {install.package()} installs packages but if you already have them it force updates the package (not great) - {library()} Loads the library of a specific package

I dont like this system so I found this package

```{r}
#install.packages('pacman') 
library(pacman)
```

My pacman package is already installed so it just takes computational power to re-install it
